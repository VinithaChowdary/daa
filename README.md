In this project, we aim to address the challenge of efficiently compressing data streams from IoT sensors to optimize communication and power usage. The focus is on developing and implementing a hybrid compression algorithm that combines Dynamic Huffman Coding with Run-Length Encoding (RLE). This approach is designed to significantly reduce the volume of data transmitted by IoT devices, which is crucial for maintaining the performance and longevity of IoT networks.

The project involves applying RLE to first eliminate redundant data, followed by Dynamic Huffman Coding to compress the data further. This two-step process leverages the strengths of both algorithms, achieving higher compression ratios and reducing power consumption compared to traditional methods like static Huffman, LZW, ZLIB, LZMA, and BZ2. The effectiveness of this hybrid method is validated using real-time data from ultrasonic sensors, demonstrating its capability to enhance data transmission efficiency while preserving data integrity. The ultimate goal is to provide a robust and practical solution for data compression in resource-constrained IoT environments, contributing to more efficient and sustainable IoT networks.
